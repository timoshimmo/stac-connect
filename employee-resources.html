          An employee's duties and rights in the employment relationship are defined by their employment contract, local legislation, and any applicable collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). Additionally, certain aspects of the working relationship may be governed by company practices, terms, and conditions that are not explicitly regulated by law.
        </p>

        <p>
          Feedback is a cornerstone of effective leadership and communication. It fosters transparency, supports continuous improvement, and strengthens workplace relationships. Without feedback, we miss opportunities to learn, grow, and help others do the same. By developing your ability to give and receive constructive feedback, you contribute to both your own growth and the success of those around you.

        <h3 class="section-subtitle">Listening</h3>
        <p>
          Listening is at the heart of all successful communication. Without active listening, messages can easily be misunderstood, leading to miscommunication. Being fully present, attentive, and asking thoughtful follow-up questions are key to meaningful dialogue.
